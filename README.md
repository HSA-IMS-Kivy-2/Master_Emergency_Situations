Master Emergency Situations - A game for Toddlers
========
Our app-idea is a very minimalistic and simple to use touch-interface mainly for toddlers.
Toddlers can master simple situations playfully. Thus they learn the different tools and the humans
who interact with.

UI-Setup: Left: Tools	| Center: Situation to solve | Right: Humans

Each situation will be solved with an unique combination of two cards. One tool-card and one human-card.

Children/toddlers can simply drag the cards around and solve the situation at hand.
A short movie will be played if the level is solved.
No level is the same, even if the game will be restarted, because cards are ordered randomly.
