Master Emergency Situations - A game for Toddlers
========

Our app-idea is a very minimalistic and simple to use touch-interface mainly for toddlers.
Toddlers can master simple situations playfully. Thus they learn the different tools and the humans
who interact with.

UI-Setup:
Left:	|Center:			|	Right:
Tools	|Situation to solve	|	Human

Each situation will be solved with an unique combination of two cards. One tool-card and one human-card.

Children/toddlers can simply drag the cards around and solve the situation at hand.
A little cartoon will be shown if the level is solved successfully. Also a sound will be played.
No level is the same, even if the game will be restarted, because cards are ordered randomly.
